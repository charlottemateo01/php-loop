    CHORUS<br>
    Bless the Lord oh my soul, oh my soul<br>
    Worship His Holy name<br>
    Sing like never before, oh my soul<br>
    I’ll worship Your Holy name<br>
    
    <br>

    VERSE 1<br>
    The sun comes up, it’s a new day dawning<br>
    It’s time to sing Your song again<br>
    Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me<br>
    Let me be singing when the evening comes<br>

    <br>

    VERSE 2<br>
    You’re rich in love and You’re slow to anger<br>
    Your name is great and Your heart is kind<br>
    For all Your goodness I will keep on singing<br>
    Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find<br>

    <br>

    VERSE 3<br>
    And on that day when my strength is failing<br>
    The end draws near and my time has come<br>
    Still my soul will sing Your praise unending<br>
    Ten thousand years and then forevermore<br>
