    <p>
    Every night in my dreams<br>
    I see you, I feel you<br>
    That is how I know you go on<br>

    <br>

    Far across the distance<br>
    And spaces between us<br>
    You have come to show you go on<br>

    <br>

    Near, far, wherever you are<br>
    I believe that the heart does go on<br>
    Once more you open the door<br>
    And you're here in my heart<br>
    And my heart will go on and on<br>

    <br>

    Love can touch us one time<br>
    And last for a lifetime<br>
    And never let go 'til we're gone<br>

    <br>

    Love was when I loved you<br>
    One true time I hold to<br>
    In my life we'll always go on<br>

    <br>

    Near, far, wherever you are<br>
    I believe that the heart does go on<br>
    Once more you open the door<br>
    And you're here in my heart<br>
    And my heart will go on and on<br>

    <br>

    You're here, there's nothing I fear<br>
    And I know that my heart will go on<br>
    We'll stay forever this way<br>
    You are safe in my heart<br>
    And my heart will go on and on<br>

    </p>
