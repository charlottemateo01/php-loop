      Oh yeah, oh yeah<br>
      Yeah, ooh, yeah<br>

      <br>

      When a day is said and done<br>
      In the middle of the night, and you're fast asleep, my love<br>
      Stay awake looking at your beauty<br>
      Telling myself I'm the luckiest man alive<br>

      <br>

     Cause so many times I was certain<br>
      You was gonna walk out of my life, life<br>
      Why you take such a hold of me, girl<br>
      When I'm still trying to get my act right?<br>

      <br>

      What is the reason when you really could have any man you want?<br>
      I don't see what I have to offer<br>
      I should've been a season<br>
      Guess you could see I had potential<br>
      Do you know you're my miracle? (Oh yeah)<br>

      <br>

      I'm like a statue<br>
      Stuck staring right at you<br>
      Got me frozen in my tracks<br>
      So amazed how you take me back<br>
      Each and every time our love collapsed<br>

      <br>

      Statue<br>
      Stuck staring right at you<br>
      So when I'm lost for words<br>
      Every time I disappoint you<br>
      It's just 'cause I can't believe<br>
      That you're so beautiful<br>
      (Stuck like a statue)<br>
      Don't wanna lose you, no<br>
      (Stuck like a statue)<br>

      <br>

      Ask myself why are you even with me<br>
      After all the shit I put you through?<br>
      Why did you make it hard so with me?<br>
      It's like you're living in an igloo<br>

      <br>

      But baby your love is so warm it makes my shield melt down, down<br>
      And every time we're both at war you make me come around<br>

      <br>

      What is the reason when you really could have any man you want?<br>
      I don't see what I have to offer<br>
      I should've been a season<br>
      Guess you could see I had potential<br>
      Do you know you're my miracle?<br>

      <br>

      I'm like a statue<br>
      Stuck staring right at you<br>
      Got me frozen in my tracks<br>
      So amazed how you take me back<br>
      Each and every time our love collapsed<br>

      <br>

      Statue<br>
      Stuck staring right at you<br>
      So when I'm lost for words<br>
      Every time I disappoint you<br>
      It's just 'cause I can't believe<br>
      That you're so beautiful<br>
      (Stuck like a statue)<br>
      Don't wanna lose you, no<br>
      (Stuck like a statue)<br>

      <br>

      And you're so beautiful<br>
      (Stuck like a statue)<br>
      Don't wanna lose you never<br>
      (Stuck like a statue)<br>
      Oh, no

      <br>

      Every single day of my life, I thank my lucky stars<br>
      God really had to spend extra time when he sculpted your heart<br>
      'Cause there's no explanation<br>
      Can't solve the equation<br>
      It's like you love me more than I love myself<br>

      <br>

      I'm like a statue<br>
      Stuck staring right at you<br>
      Got me frozen in my tracks<br>
      So amazed how you take me back<br>
      Each and every time our love collapsed<br>

      <br>

      Statue<br>
      Stuck staring right at you<br>
      So when I'm lost for words (Statue)<br>
      Every time I disappoint you<br>
      Baby, it's 'cause I can't believe ('Cause you're my statue)<br>

      <br>

      That you're so beautiful (Girl, you are the reason)<br>
      Stuck like a statue (The reason for living)<br>
      Don't wanna lose you, no (The reason for breathing)<br>
      Stuck like a statue (You're so beautiful)<br>

      <br>

      And you're so beautiful (And I want you to feel it)<br>
      Stuck like a statue ('Cause so bad I mean it)<br>
      Don't wanna lose you, no (You're the reason for breathing)<br>
      Stuck like a statue (You're so beautiful)<br>
      Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>

      <br>

      When the day is said and done<br>
      In the middle of the night, and you're fast asleep, my love<br>
      I'm the luckiest man alive<br>
