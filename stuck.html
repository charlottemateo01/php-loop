    <p>
		I was too dumb to notice<br>
		That there's something about you<br>
		What am I supposed to do?<br>
		I sure wish I knew<br>
	
		<br>

		All the butterflies I felt inside<br>
		Never really mattered<br>
		Wishful thoughts and sudden smiles<br>
		Ended being shattered<br>

		<br>
		
		What are we supposed to be<br>
		I'm hopelessly addicted to you<br>
		But you never felt the same<br>
		
		<br>

		Time may pass us<br>
		By but you stay stuck on my mind<br>
		And that moment we stared<br>
		That night I thought it was right<br>
		But maybe I was wrong all along<br>
		
		<br>
		
		I held onto something that never really mattered<br>
		Stuck on that starting line<br>
		I'm still silently quietly hoping<br>
		You'll end up with me<br>

		<br>

		I was too dumb to notice<br>
		There was something about you<br>
		How are you supposed to see things<br>
		If only you knew<br>

		<br>

		All the times we were together<br>
		I never really mattered<br>
		All you see is what you want<br>
		My heart is being shattered<br>
		
		<br>

		What are we supposed to be<br>
		I'm helplessly addicted to you<br>
		But you never felt the same<br>

		<br>

		Time may pass us by<br>
		But you stay stuck on my mind<br>
		And that moment we stared<br>
		That night I thought it was right<br>
		But maybe I was wrong all along<br>

		<br>
		
		I held onto something that never really mattered<br>
		Stuck on that starting line<br>
		I'm still silently quietly hoping<br>
		You'll end up with me<br>

		<br>

		Time may pass us<br>
		By but you stay stuck on my mind<br>
		And that moment we stared<br>
		That night I thought it was right<br>

		<br>

		Time may pass us<br>
		By but you stay stuck on my mind<br>
		And that moment we stared<br>
		That night I thought it was right<br>
		But maybe I was wrong all along<br>

		<br>
		
		I held onto something that never really mattered<br>
		Stuck on that starting line<br>
		I'm still silently quietly hoping<br>
		You'll end up with me<br>

		<br>

		I was too dumb to notice<br>
		That there's something about you<br>
		What am I supposed to do if<br>
		I'm still stuck on you<br>
